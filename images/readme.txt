	1.	Edit the module logo in images/ventrilo 
		to include some artwork, and your module name.
	2.	Delete this section of the readme.txt file.
	3.	This module should install & run. But it doesn't do anything yet.
		Start coding your modules features!
	4.	Search the code for {{{{. This marks things you need to change
		For example, in the documentation, you'll need to fill in the skeleton
	4.	Visit www.worldware.com and leave a message in the forums, to
