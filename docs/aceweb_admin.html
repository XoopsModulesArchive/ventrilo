		they can be corrected. 
		<h2><a name="upgrade">Upgrading {{{{ Fill In Your Xoops Version }}}} from Previous Versions</a></h2>

<P>{{{{ If there was a previous version, let people know what the upgrade will mean. Do they have to uninstall? Re-enter all data?}}}}</P>
		<h2><a name="install">Installing AceWeb</a></h2>
		<P>AceWeb is installed just like any other xoops module.</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Unzip the aceweb-X.XX.zip file into your modules directory.
			<LI>
				Go to the xoops admin/system admin/modules page (hitting refresh if 
				necessary), and click on the install icon for AceWeb.
			</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>You are now ready to configure AceWeb.</P>
		<h2><a name="configure">Configuring AceWeb</a></h2>

		<P>AceWeb has a number of settings that control the display and operation of the 
			AceWeb.

  in your settings for each configuration field.}}}}</LI>

		<h3> Other 	Configuration</h3>
		<p>This section is general information about xoops and blocks, it is not specific 
			to AceWeb</p>
		<h4>Block Visibility in Xoops</h4>
		<P>To control block placement and visibility in xoops, go to /admin.php, and select 
			"System Admin", and then select blocks. Check the blocks you want to be 
			visible, and their positions</P>
		<P>One of the more common questions asked in xoops is "Why can't people see my 
			blocks?". The answer is you need to enable block visibility for anonymous 
			users, if you want casual visitors to your site to see this module.
			This can be done under xoops administration/groups/anonymous users. Check next 
			to every block you want visitors who have not signed in.
		</P>
		<P>You need to do this for module access, and block access, but NOT for 
			administration.</P>
		<h4>Block Titles</h4>
		<P>The block titles are displayed at the top of the block. By default, xoops sets the block title to be the 
		same as the block name. Go to System Administration/blocks and click on "Edit" next to the block whose title you want to change. </P>

		<h2><a name="blocks">Blocks</a></h2>
		AceWeb includes the following blocks
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="#b_titles">Block One</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3><a name="b_titles"></a>Block 
One</A></h3>
		<P>{{{{ Describe the block. Bear in mind that the person reading this may have just installed the block,
		and may not understand all aspects of the module. Try to make this description short, and self contained.}}}}</P>
